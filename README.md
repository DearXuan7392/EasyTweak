### Enable

Only when this item is set to ``true``, will the other modifications take effect

The following features will take effect immediately:

1. Spawners can be mined, but they no longer drop XP. Instead, they drop the spawn egg inside;

2. Right-clicking a spawner with a spawn egg will replace the original spawn egg with the one in your hand, and the spawn egg inside will drop;

3. Placing a torch or soul torch on the spawner will disable it;

4. When a spawner receive redstone power, it will continuously spawn mobs regardless of player proximity;
